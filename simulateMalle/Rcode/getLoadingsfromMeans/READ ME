FILE CONTENTS:

"dweck averages.csv"
	contains the mean and confidence interval data
	for each character for each item
	File layout:
		column1: items
		column2: average loadings for items
		column3: response means for stapler character
		column4: upper value from confidence interval for column 3
		column5: same as column3 but for car character
		column6: same as column4 but for car character
		 . . . : do for each character
		column42: same as column3 but for adult character
		column43: same as column4 but for adult character

"getRaw.R"
	simulates raw data using data from "dweck averages.csv"
	stores data for each character in a csv labeled "columnNumber character.csv"

"fullSimulated.R"
	combines all simulated data from each character csv into one dataframe
	stores combined data into csv labeled "simulatedDataDweck.csv"

"pcaOnRawData.R"
	uses combined simulation data and performs PCA
	loadings are stored in a csv labeled "loadingsSimulated.csv
